# SongySideUp

A web app which generates a curated playlist for a specified user using the spotify api so that they can start their day a little sunnier with breakfast (maybe, a sunny side up egg?) and some music!

#Inspiration
With today's stay at home culture due to the global pandemic, it's easy to feel isolated and lonely. Mental health is extremely important, and studies find that music helps to uplift people's moods. We hope this app will do the same!

Generates a playlist on the front end from a person's spotify top tracks.
